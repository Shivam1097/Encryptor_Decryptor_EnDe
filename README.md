# Encryptor_Decryptor_EnDe

This software can be used for encrypting a text file.

I coded it in PYTHON and  then created a standalone executable using pyinstaller package to run on both 32 and 64 bit Windows .

Simply download the appropriate package(x64 or x86).

Extract the archieve using 'WINRAR' or any other application.You can download WINRAR from 'https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0'

Run EnDe_by_SHIVAM.exe 

Follow the instructions after running the exe. 

Make sure that you place the the file to be encrypted in the same directory where EnDe_by_SHIVAM.exe is located.

Also do not forget to delete the source Text file which is to be encrypted, after encryption is completed.

In case of any trouble releted to this software or feedback ....just mail to ----'shivam.dev1097@gmail.com'
